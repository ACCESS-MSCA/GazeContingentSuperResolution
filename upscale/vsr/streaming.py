"""Streaming VSR for callers that feed frames in batches rather than whole clips.

Calling `VSRPipeline` once per batch would restart the keyframe stride at every
batch boundary, because the last frame of each call is forced to be a keyframe.
At K=2 with 2-frame batches that degenerates to `SSSSSS` -- every frame super-
resolved, K doing nothing at all.

`VSRStream` keeps the stride global to the clip by carrying the previous
keyframe across calls. Keyframe membership is decided by absolute frame index
(`index % k == 0`), so it is independent of how the caller happens to chunk
its input.

The cost is latency: a frame between two keyframes cannot be emitted until the
*following* keyframe has arrived, so `push()` may return fewer frames than it
was given (or none). Call `flush()` at the end of the clip to drain the tail.
Frames come out in order, and pushes plus the flush yield exactly as many
frames as went in.
