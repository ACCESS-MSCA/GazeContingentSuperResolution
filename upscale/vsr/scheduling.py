"""Keyframe scheduling for K-strided VSR.

The pipeline trades diffusion-SR calls for cheap RIFE interpolation: only
every K-th frame is super-resolved, and the frames in between are synthesized
from the surrounding HR keyframe pair. The frame count is preserved -- N
frames in, N frames out.

Scheduling is expressed as keyframe indices plus per-gap timesteps.
